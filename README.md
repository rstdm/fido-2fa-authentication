This project is part of the Module 'Sicherheit und Webanwendungen' at the University of Applied Sciences in LÃ¼beck.

It was the goal, to demonstrate the usage of the FIDO2 protocol in a web application and to implement a FIDO2 server.
You can register and authenticate with a FIDO2 device (from Yubikey). Your registert device will be stored in a persistent database.
Beware that the FIDO2 server is not production ready and should not be used in a production environment.
